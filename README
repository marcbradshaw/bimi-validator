This is an example implementation of a BIMI validator using the Mail::BIMI
validation code.

BIMI implementations differ across different mailbox providers, and while this
validator attempts to follow the most current BIMI specification it should be
noted that there may be additional requirements at individual MBPs which must also
be met before a BIMI indicator is displayed.
